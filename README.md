# Linkedin API & scraper
This service allows to retrieve data about people or company on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com), through the official Linkedin API, or when it is not possible, through a web scraper using [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer).

## Demo
You can try out the tool on my personal server [here](https://linkedin.cooya.fr).

## Installation
If you want to install it for your own, you will need to own a Linkedin account and to create an app [here](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps/new).
You will also need to create a config file (called "config.js") from the [config template file](https://github.com/Cooya/Linkedin/blob/master/config.template) at the root of the directory, and to complete it with all the required information.

### Download the project and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cooya/Linkedin.git
cd Linkedin
npm install
```
### Build the production web bundle with Webpack
```bash
npm run build
```

### Run the development server
```bash
npm start
```

### Or run the production server
```bash
sudo npm install -g forever
npm run server
```

## Important tips
It may need Linux dependencies to run Chromium :
```bash
sudo apt install gconf-service libasound2 libatk1.0-0 libc6 libcairo2 libcups2 libdbus-1-3 libexpat1 libfontconfig1 libgcc1 libgconf-2-4 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libglib2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libnspr4 libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libstdc++6 libx11-6 libx11-xcb1 libxcb1 libxcomposite1 libxcursor1 libxdamage1 libxext6 libxfixes3 libxi6 libxrandr2 libxrender1 libxss1 libxtst6 ca-certificates fonts-liberation libappindicator1 libnss3 lsb-release xdg-utils wget
```

The project is designed to log in and retrieve automatically the access token for the Linkedin API but you may encounter some issues with the authentification process, especially if you run the project on your server. For my personal case, I had to copy my local cookies file generated by Chrome to my server to skip the log in process because, my server being in a foreign country, a code is asked to secure the log in from this location.

## Tests
After creating and filling out the config file, you are able to run the tests with the following command :
```bash
npm test
```
